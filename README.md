# How to Launch
There is a server located in the api forlder and a client located in client folder.

In order to run them, one must go into each forlder and run 'npm install' in order 
to get all the dependencies. Following that, run 'npm start' in both folders. The react client is set up to run on port 3000 and the node and express server run on port 5000.
